# @ultimabase/schema

Static schema declarations are the source of truth for UltimaBase.

Responsibilities:

- `defineSchema`;
- primitive field definitions;
- system-field metadata;
- schema and field extension contracts;
- indexes and declarative constraints;
- TypeScript inference;
- isolated `SchemaRegistry` instances.

This package must not know ACL, CLP, roles, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, Hono, or GraphQL. Optional capabilities contribute opaque, typed extensions that runtime plugins later claim.
