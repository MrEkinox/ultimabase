# @ultimabase/runtime

The single business-operation engine used by every transport.

Responsibilities:

- `FrameworkEngine` and request-bound engines;
- anonymous, user, and master contexts;
- CRUD, bulk operations, and upserts;
- deterministic operation pipeline;
- hooks and post-commit events;
- transactions;
- AsyncLocalStorage helpers;
- database adapter contracts and execution.

Runtime does not import Drizzle, PostgreSQL, Hono, GraphQL, Yoga, or concrete permission plugins.

Runtime re-exports the neutral `BoundQuery` facade from `@ultimabase/query`.
The future `RequestEngine` will create those bound instances and execute their
terminal operations through the single Runtime pipeline.

## Request contexts

Public code can create immutable anonymous or authenticated user contexts:

```ts
const tenantRead = new RequestCapability('tenant:read')

const context = RequestContext.user(userId, {
	requestId: 'request-01',
	source: requestSources.graphql,
	capabilities: [tenantRead],
	metadata: { traceId: 'trace-01' },
})

context.access // { mode: 'user', userId }
context.hasCapability(tenantRead) // true
```

Custom transport plugins may use their own non-empty source literal, such as
`grpc`. Options, metadata records, access state, capability collections, and
the context instance are copied or frozen at their boundary.

There is deliberately no public master-context factory yet. Issue 319 will add
trusted `RequestEngine` elevation with a mandatory reason and an audit-ready
event; raw master keys will only be verification inputs and will never be
retained by `RequestContext`.

## Database adapter boundary

Database plugins implement `DatabaseAdapter`; application developers normally
receive one from a plugin such as the future `postgresPlugin`. The contract
receives only a normalized operation and portable access constraints. SQL,
Drizzle sessions, and transport state remain private to concrete plugins.

Every call keeps the operation-specific result type:

```ts
const articles = await adapter.execute({
	operation: {
		kind: 'find',
		query: new Query(articleSchema).limit(20).ast,
	},
	accessConstraints: [{ kind: 'tenant', tenantId: 'tenant-1' }],
})

// readonly Partial<Article>[]
```

`beginTransaction()` returns a distinguishable
`DatabaseTransactionAdapter`. It can execute operations and then `commit()` or
`rollback()`, but cannot silently create nested transactions.
