# @ultimabase/runtime

The single business-operation engine used by every transport.

Responsibilities:

- `FrameworkEngine` and request-bound engines;
- anonymous, user, and master contexts;
- CRUD, bulk operations, and upserts;
- deterministic operation pipeline;
- hooks and post-commit events;
- transactions;
- AsyncLocalStorage helpers;
- database adapter contracts and execution.

Runtime does not import Drizzle, PostgreSQL, Hono, GraphQL, Yoga, or concrete permission plugins.

Runtime re-exports the neutral `BoundQuery` facade from `@ultimabase/query`.
The future `RequestEngine` will create those bound instances and execute their
terminal operations through the single Runtime pipeline.
